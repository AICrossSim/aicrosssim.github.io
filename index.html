<p style="font-family: 'Lato', Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We are AICrossSim.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Lato', Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;">With the emergence of various AI model scaling laws, a critical question arises: Can existing hardware support the
growth of these models, or will there be a significant game-changer that can perform the same tasks at radically lower
costs? For these potentially groundbreaking or bold hardware designs, we are interested in estimating their impact on both
system-level power and performance, as well as model-level accuracy.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Lato', Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The AICrossSim (also known as AIXSim) collective, comprising experts from Imperial College London, the University of
Cambridge, and the University of Edinburgh, strives to develop a collection of open-source instruments and frameworks dedicated to overcoming the cross-stack simulation obstacle. This endeavor is financed by the Advanced Research and
Invention Agency (ARIA) as a part of the <a href="https://www.aria.org.uk/opportunity-spaces/nature-computes-better/scaling-compute/">Scaling Compute program</a>.</p>
